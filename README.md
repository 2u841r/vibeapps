## Admin Setup

To access the admin dashboard at `/admin`, you need to set up the admin role in Clerk for your user account.

### Setting Up Admin Role

1. **Go to the Clerk Dashboard**: Navigate to your Clerk application dashboard at [https://dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)

2. **Navigate to Users**: In the left sidebar, click on "Users" to view all registered users

3. **Select Your User**: Find and click on your user account that you want to make an admin

4. **Edit User Metadata**:

   - Scroll down to the "Metadata" section
   - Click on "Public metadata"
   - Add the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```

   - Click "Save" to apply the changes

5. **Sign Out and Sign Back In**: For the role changes to take effect, sign out of your Vibe Apps application and sign back in

6. **Access Admin Dashboard**: You should now be able to access the admin dashboard at `/admin`

### Admin Features Available

### Troubleshooting Admin Access

If you can't access the admin dashboard after setting the role:

- Check that the JSON is properly formatted in the Clerk dashboard
- Verify the role is set as "admin" (case-sensitive)
- Check your browser's developer console for any authentication errors
