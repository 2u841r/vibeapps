## Previous Updates

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Update TopCategoriesOfWeek Navigation

- **Fixed**: Clicking tags in "Top Categories This Week" no longer leads to a 404 page.

- **Changed**: `TopCategoriesOfWeek.tsx` now requires `selectedTagId` and `setSelectedTagId` props to be passed from its parent component to manage the shared selection state.
